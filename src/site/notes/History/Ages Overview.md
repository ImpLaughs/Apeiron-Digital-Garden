# Umbral Era 
## (Unknown Length of Time)
A time of true darkness and entropy. The Umbral Era was the age of war, death, and destruction. Civilization tried to flourish, but the [[Primordial Titans|Primordial Titans]] roamed and conquered all of the material. It wasn't until the pleas of civilization coalesced into a unified voice that the divine beings responded. This response, though pivotal to the flourishing of Apeiron, this decision to respond to mortal wishes would soon lead to [[The Schism of the Divine|The Schism of the Divine]]. Many scholars are unsure of what exactly transpired when they sent one of their own to the material plane, but the consequences of such intervention are clear upon the world. Dragons took flight once the blinding light ceased. The chromatic dragons led by [[Ashardalon|Ashardalon]], The Red, sprang forth to conquer the Primordials for the mortals of Apeiron. One by one, the primordials fell beneath the draconic wings, claiming to have been sent by their Divine God. It was during this time that [[Ymearlis|Ymearlis']] Hand of Winter was severed and stored in the fabled sword of [[Czyste Zimno|Czyste Zimno]], a weapon of the dragon Ashardalon.
# Scorched Age 
## (0 - 282, Month 7)
Though the mortals were saved from the Primordials, they had traded one ruler for another. Ashardalon and [[The Chromatic Dragons|The Chromatic Dragons]] ruled with an iron fist to subjugate all for their amusement and malevolent glory, while [[The Metallic Dragons|The Metallic Dragons]] (led by [[Valamaradace|Valamaradace]], [[Jalavaloss|Jalavaloss]], and [[Nymmurh|Nymmurh]]) ruled through the worship of mortals, gaining power and glory through their rule. Desperate to keep order, and increase their own power, the Metallic Dragons began to war with the Chromatic in what would be known as [[The Scale War|The Scale War]]. The war persisted for 50 years until [[The Gemstone Dragons|The Gemstone Dragons]], horrified by the war of their cousins, vanished in neutrality. The war continued for over 200 years until the efforts of [[The Cloudstabbers|The Cloudstabbers]] and [[The Closed Eye|The Closed Eye]], among other organizations and alliances, rendered the draconic threat ended. At the same time as Ashardalon fell, [[Divine Beings/Prime Deities/Individual/Helm|Helm, the Vigilant One]] stepped foot on Apeiron. With their first step, Apeiron was sundered, split into pieces. With their second step, they took their pure divine magic from the realm. With their word, a ward was placed upon the planes to keep all divine or fiend from traveling between. No divine beings (Prime or not) could step forth in the material plane again. With a wave of their hand, the material...was alone. 
# Ashen Ground 
## (282, Month 8 - 1045, Month 2)
In the aftermath of the [[The Scale War|war]] and [[The Schism of the Divine|Schism]], the material plane was left alone and far from the machinations of extra-planar entities. No others could aspire to the height of gods, meddle with them, or beckon the might of any (Betrayer or otherwise); however, many sought their wisdom, boons, banes, and leadership through the Divine Gate. With higher powers gone from the world, mortals had to fend for themselves as best as they could against monstrous threats that had stayed and festered on their home. This age was full of darkness, betrayal, and little hope, until, miraculously, [[Eden|Eden]], the first city of Aperion, rose to the skies away from the blighted and scarred land. Though, this era of hopelessness would continue with what would be called [[The Fall of Eden|The Fall of Eden]]. In the years following Eden's fall, the mortals of Apeiron saw their unification under one banner as a sign of doom, the final verification that they could not reach their gods. They began to retreat from each other and form their own kingdoms to look after by year 647 in [[The Dividing of Land|The Dividing of Land]]. The Ashen Ground pressed onward as mortals reaped the benefits of their persistance, with many kingdoms rising and falling across the continents until an event known as [[The Bridge of Stars|The Bridge of Stars]] came to pass.
# Phoenix Time 
## (1045, Month 3 - 1437, Month 6)
The Bridge of Stars brought gifts of splendor to Apeiron aplenty. Lands prospered, kingdoms rose, and lineages continued without fear of divine beings, falling citadels, or the like. This gift of life came with the gift of death. [[Mivildir|Mivildir]] and their Undying Legion rose in the era of life to spread their plague across the land. By twisting their power of the dark in the world, they sought to bring about a great eclipse of the stars, to have mortals become forever undying to keep them safe from divine threats they claimed to see in the coming cycles. In this [[Battle of Blood and Bone|Battle of Blood and Bone]], Mivildir was slain by an alliance of the kingdoms of Apeiron. In the years that followed, the [[Alliance of Life|Alliance of Life]] would fade from memory, but all of Apeiron would reap the benefits of such an allegiance for years to come. During this age, flame flowed through Soven'dul, as [[The Lost Child|The Lost Child]] rose in power, threatening to destroy [[The Divine Gate|The Divine Gate]] of Apeiron, and inscribe the names of their parentage upon the [[Seat of Creation|Seat of Creation]]. They were defeated and locked away by the archmage [[Marsola Doon|Marsola Doon]] in what would be called [[The Revelation of Sol|The Revelation of Sol]]. With The Lost Child's fall, the age of the Phoenix was finished to usher in The Renewal Era.

# Renewal Era
## (1437, Month 7 - Current)
Apeiron is in an era of renewal and life. Potential is abundant and the denizens of the world have many paths to choose from. Renewal brings opportunity, great riches, and the potential for returning foes...
