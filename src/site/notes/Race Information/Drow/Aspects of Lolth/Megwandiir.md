# Megwandiir
	"None follow the teachings of Lolth as Megwandiir: the weak will be weeded 
	out, and the strong shall be moreso. We are as precise as her spiders. We 
	wait for days on end for the opportunity to strike. The traps we lay, the 
	poison we use, the hardship we face...it is all the same as her spiders. We 
	may only hope to do our Spider Queen proud." -- Aranae Trainer

The Megwandiir Clan is better known as The Spider Clan. Everything they do, in architecture, in hunting, in mannerism, and more is done to emulate the many types of spiders present under Lolth's command. They view all other creatures as imperfect in comparison. A common teaching is that a spider may not confront the mammoth beetle directly not out of fear or weakness, but out of pity for its goals are above the beetle. If a Megwandiir drow cannot use something to benefit their goal, they will eliminate it with precision and lethality. 

# Summary

Megwandiir is the aspect of Lolth that rules over the arachnids of Soven'dul and all other realms. She is all around the drow, almost constantly. The spiders they revere and live alongside are her eyes and ears. Every spider is a link to the most strange and otherworldly aspect of Lolth. Megwandiir influences the drow in subtle ways, the beautiful webs her creatures spin enchant them and the drow seek to emulate them in the design of their houses, fortresses, and cities. 

Megwandiir rarely uses avatars or ancestral agents as drow understand them. If she wishes to show someone something, she will use her arachnid servants. They will gather around a door to show the way, block the path to help in attacks on one's foes, lace poison in an adulterer's drink. She shows her favor by having arachnids stay close to her chosen, and equally those who displease her will be attacked, bitten, and eaten to fuel the stronger. 

She expects her followers to emulate the cold blooded, mindless predation of the arachnid. Megwandiir demands that her chosen -- The Aranae -- be emotionless killers, with no sense of remorse or guilt. All that matters is the solitary pursuit of predatory excellence. The drow believe that this is why their society was built upon the basis of the strong culling the weak, the ruling elite preying on the underclasses. Megwandiir, they believe, seeks to strengthen her people as she was strengthened in her ageless time. 

The followers of Megwandiir believe she represents an unattainable perfection. They can never truly be like this aspect as they can neither emulate her physical appearance, nor be as emotionless as the arachnids who server her -- but not for lack of trying. Those of their people who achieve closeness with this aspect are seen as cold and unapproachable, they are solitary and withdrawn. They are feared on the battlefield and on the hunt as they are merciless and lethal. 

Her followers rarely pray and she rarely offers anything in return. They often ignore the world around her and the actions of other aspects. Megwandiir is dedicated solely to the hunt of her prey and her continued dominance throughout. 

She represents the clinical precision of the arachnid predator. She is the physical manifestation of Lolth, and the one the Drow saw at the Webbed Throne millenia ago. To follow her is to follow her actions and her teachings. To be one of her children is to overcome fear, emotion, and adversity. To be one of her followers is to become as deadly and precise as the spider queen herself. In doing so, the drow of Megwandiir hope to give their queen a physical foothold once more.

To the other asepcts, Megwandiir should be emulated in her teachings and lessons of mercilessness. She teaches Drow what dragonkind will be like should they continue to exist, and how to be better than them. They view her followers as isolated, not truly knowing what atrocities they commit in their kingdom, as they care only for survival of the fittest. Rarely do the other aspects seek interaction with Megwandiir, for it often ends with blood being spilled, or a physical altercation at least.
