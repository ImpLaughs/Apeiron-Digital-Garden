# Lareth

	"Lareth begets suffering. Of fire, and death, and temptation. It is within 
	that fire that swords are forged stronger. Unwavering faith, a pillar 
	standing resolute against waves of heresy, begets salvation from the world 
	dragonkind left us. Lareth gave us a chance, we owe everything to her. She is 
	our queen. Our savior." -- High Inquisitor of Lareth

# Summary
Lareth is the aspect that rules over the hearts of the faithful. It is the hand of Lareth that continually tempts and tricks Drow society. Lareth is the embodiment of whispers of power that would come from forsaking Lolth, she who speaks of forbidden lore and hidden secrets. She will forever test Drow society through strife and hardship, for what comes from passing the test is salvation and peace beside the Webbed Throne of Lolth. 

She will seek out powerful and lowly alike to try and sway her people from the proper path with gifts and promises of greater glory for the individual. She saw the drow as a people, as one, to forsake the people they come from would mean to forsake their savior...and to welcome doom upon oneself. She seeks to inspire those who search endlessly for the weak and unfaithful, she loves inquisitors and the zealous priestesses of her people as they demonstrate unwavering loyalty. 

Lareth expects her people to seek out the unfaithful at all times; however, she prefers them to trick their targets into revealing their heresy. Clever questioning, elaborate operations, spying, and trapping are her favored activities. Lareth delights in testing the faithful at inopportune moments -- taking them from high profile meetings or enjoyable past-times. It is this aspect of Lolth that [[Vhontree Maeth|Vhontree Maeth]] appeased to convince Lolth to save her people, and it is this aspect that the Drow owe their lives (and cunning) to. 

If Lareth were to choose to elevate someone to the ranks of her chosen, she would expect them to become a relentless force against those who turn their back on their queen. Many of her followers warn each other that such elevation is not purely a blessing as she tests her own followers even more than those of the general drow population. These higher ranks, the Webbed Ones, are known for spinning lies, laying traps, and seeing the threads of deceit among any they come across. One must be prepared to confront even the highest placed of the drow people should they descend into heresy. Lareth always reminds the drow -- she is their queen, all others are less and should not be prioritized over her. 

Lareth seeks to constantly tempt her people so that only the strong of faith will prosper, for she always rewards those of faith. She has even been known to aid drow enemies if they seek to undermine drow faith. She is ever watchful, seeking always for the weak of mind and the faithless. There are stories of her Demonweb, a spot reserved for those who fell for her temptations. None ever return. 

As followers of Lareth, they must be wary of her and the temptations she represents, but must also welcome the questioning of their faith and the many tests she will force upon them. For it is because of her that drow breathe. It is because of her that they survive. And it is because of her, that the drow are better. Lareth keeps drow pure and focused. Lareth inspires the drow to an ever greater understanding of true faith, dedication to it, and the rewards of trusting in the one true goddess. 

The other aspects view followers of Lareth as paranoid, as a cautionary tale of forgetting to live rather than just survive. They view Lareth's people as zealots, and many wonder if it is them who destroyed Lothiriel in the first place. When interacting with a Lareth follower, it is best to hold your coin purse, keep your wits about you, and trust them only as far as one can see in the surface world at star peak.
