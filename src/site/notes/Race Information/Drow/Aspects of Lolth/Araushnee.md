# Araushnee
	"The Way of Araushnee is paved with scrolls and learning. To be in 
	Araushnee's shadow is to be in the presence of omniscence. Though we drow 
	could never hope to reach her level, we strive to emulate her in the ways of 
	the web. Magic and lore, like the races of this vile place, is ours to 
	command, control, and create." -- The Teachings of Araushnee

The Clan of Araushnee acts as scholarly advisors in the far northern region of Soven'dul. Rumored to be working with the dwarves of Mysteria, they see other races as inferior in intellect and ettiquette, more willing than the other clans to employ barbaric races to do their work for them. 

# Summary

Araushnee is the aspect of Lolth that rules over and controls the destiny of her chosen people. This aspect is rarely seen nor felt in any obvious way; however, it is the hand of Araushnee that guides people through dreams and visions. It is this aspect that revealed her secrets to Vhontree Maeth and her first Children of Lolth, and it is this aspect that continues to guide them. 

Araushnee has no need for avatars or ancestral agents, if she wishes to guide you in your endeavours; you will receive visions during prayer or maybe prophetic dreams. Sometimes she manifets as a flash of inspiration or foreboding. As such, she is venerated by followers as a guding hand in times of need. 

She expects loyalty and honesty from her people. Should she honor one with revelations, then they must be acted upon, for she has chosen you for a reason and to keep from her is a slight upon her and to ignore her insight is to invite doom. It is a slap in the face of Drow ancestors (Vhontree Maeth) who followed those visions and insights and ultimately led to the salvation of her people. 

The followers of this aspect know that the other aspects of Lolth can be contrary and sometimes in diametric opposition to each other; however, they know that Araushnee seeks to guide them toward ultiamte destiny. Much like Vhontree Maeth being guided to the ultimate destiny of the creation of the Drow, she too seeks to guide Drow toward their destiny of joining her by her side. Her guidance should always be heeded, if not immediately then most certainly in the near future. 

She represents the curiosity of Lolth, a patron of the Drow academics and seats of learning. Her faith coincides with the keeping of The Whisper Web, a most sacred library. Academics in her society are revered, as they have been spoken to by Araushnee, and what the most scholared say should be treated as words of their queen. It is best to show the most learned of her people respect, lest one anger her in turn. 

Araushnee is the guardian of truth and the keeper of Drow history. She saw Drow for who they were, who they wanted to be, and who they ultimately are before even they knew it. She is all knowing. She is all seeing. She is all feeling. Her gifts that may come to a drow may appear one way, but it is in one's faith to her that they realize the gift was something else entirely. Her people follow the quest of maintaining histories, rites, and rituals. The passing of knowledge from one generation to the next. They must separate from the chaos in their society if they not only want to survive, but thrive in Lolth's shadow. 

She is best described as the rock in a swirling sea of chaos and change. She is the light in the darkness of the undergound, of ignorance. She is the origin and inspiration for Drow everywhere. 

To the other clans, Araushnee is seen as capable in only one respect -- knowledge. Many feel that the followers of this aspect do not follow through and have grown soft in comparison to what they believe drow *should* become and be. To follow Araushnee is to follow an idealized version of Lolth, which many believe to be as heretical as following Lothiriel.
