# Zanassu
	"War brings us to our queen. Peace brings us to our queen. Our understanding 
	of both gives us the honor of being her War Weavers, her chosen warriors to 
	spread her rage and power upon the weak. We are relentless. We are many. Our 
	screams will fill the air in death and in life." -- War Weaver Commander

The Zanassu Clan is better known as the War Clan among the several aspects of Lolth. They revel in peace and the war sought out to bring peace upon their people. Associated with Valla'eli, the post-war ritual of peace, and the crazed war tactics of their War Weavers, the Clan of Zanassu is not one to trifle with on the battlefield. Though their intentions are somewhat pure in seeking peace, they see no direct need to expedite a battle to reach said peace as they see their queen on and off the battlefield. They believe themselves superior to the other drow clans as they have a keen understanding of war and the peace it brings about. 

# Summary
Zanassu is the aspect of Lolth that rules over the destructive and warlike qualities. This aspect is embodied in ancestral warriors of Lolth's armies. Zanassu inspires leaders to conquest and war, whether between houses, cities, races of the world, or beyond. It is this aspect which inspires warriors and generals on the battlefield or when they are at rest with dreams of conquest and destruction. 

Zanassu is said to be heard in Drow war chants and is served by ancestral warriors of great renown and skill -- The War Weavers. She delights in the thrill of melee combat and destruction caused by long sieges. Those who harbor destruction and revenge in their hearts -- particularly against dragonkind -- often find a receptive mistress in Zanassu. Her armies are relentless, willing to sacrifice countless losses for the glory of victory. 

This matron expects her devoted to constantly search for legitimate targets for her wrath, seeking out powerful threats to destroy. When such threats are in short supply, they partake in a ritual known as Valla'eli. This ritual lasts for an undefined amount of time as the drow revel in the quiet peace of post-war times, believing such time to be sacred and as close as they can be to Lolth after she has destroyed her foes. The Zanassu Clan fight to join Zanassu on the battlefield and in the blood of strong foes, but for the quiet of peace is fought for as well as Zanassu is present in both periods. 

The drow understand that her wrath and hatred is useful and appealing. She is the one who inspired Vhontree Maeth to swear vengeance upon dragonkind, and the one who emboldens her ancestors to continue the quest of conquest to become the ultimate people. Many of her followers believe this to be the prime aspect of Lolth, and see beauty in destruction. Oftentimes they are considered the most optimistic of drow, as they see their queen in the absence and in peace of life. 

If left unattended during Valla'eli for too long, however, the Clan of Zanassu is known to enter a restless rage called Surt'gallok in which they partake in unfiltered violence against each other in a civil war or, to the dismay of other clans, the other aspects and surrounding settlements. As such, Zanassu clans are typically supported by other aspects and pointed toward impossible goals to keep them busy and out of Valla'eli for long periods of time. 

Those who choose to follow the path of Zanassu are to be watched at all times. If left unattended when away from the front they will begin to destroy all that our race has built and achieved. They are at best shock troops to be flung at the enemy where their love of carnage and destruction can be put to some use.

The other aspects fear the might of Zanassu, but revel in the fact that they are easily distracted and emotional. They view them as barbaric, unrefined in comparison to the other aspects, yet to be feared as they seem to be endless in their waves of trained soldiers. She embodies survival of the fittest clearly, and many aspects see it to be revered, yet believe it to be to the detriment of the drow race at times. To cross paths with a follower of Zanassu is to cross paths with war itself.
