# Moandiir
	"Life and death are childish understandings of existence. Moandiir teaches 
	that one does not end the other. Energry does not die, it merely changes 
	forms. We seek to understand both forms, to value the death given and the 
	life taken, and to conquer the corruption within us all. That makes us the 
	better Drow. " -- Scribe of The Bloodied

The Moandiir Clan is a more philosophical and earthly clan than the others. They seek understanding of that which they do not know fully, and it is in this pursuit that they are superior. Their command of undeath, precision of disease, and alchemy of corruption gives them a unique perspective on the changing of forms -- of life and death. Led by The Bloodied, they spend time aspiring to reach Lolth's supreme wisdom while valuing all they have been given. 

# Summary
Moandiir is the aspect of Lolth that speaks of powers of corruption and of necromancy.  She seeks to create eternal servants in the form of the unliving. Moandiir loves to create and spread diseases to sort the strong from the weak. 

Moandiir primarily acts through powerful unliving servants. Her devout followers, The Bloodied, enact her will. She seeks to tempt her people into exploring the meaning of life, and the sanctity of death itself. She views neither as a beginning or end, just a change of form. She tempts and guides her drow with the power corruption can bestow, promising an exalted rank in exchange for eternal servitude. As such, she is venerated by those who work to uncover the many secrets of unlife, mysteries of corruption, and the uncertainty of life. 

She expects her followers to experience life, death, and unlife while experimenting with the corruptions and diseases of the world. Her followers should form an intimate understanding of the cycle of life and what she calls The Changing of Forms. She holds respect of life and expects her followers to do the same while not wasting the changing of forms. Any follower that does not utilize the whole animal, for example, would be looked upon with shame. 

Moandiir represents the destructive and wise nature of Lolth. She is the aspect that represents the corruption and constant cycle of life in the undergorund. Poison that eats away at her enemies that she utilizes is her ichor, and the Drow seek to reach such perfection in their own alchemy. 

She is the poison in the heart of Lolth. She is the cycle of life and death that Lolth has found herself in. She is the spreading of Lolth's web personified. The drow believe they follow her to keep her corruption in check for when she changes form to become Lolth once more. The Bloodied Ones are the ones who command, and control her undead creatures in her legions. Moandiir is the aspect that inspires drow to maintain control of all parts of life and death. The followers of Moandiir must stay vigilant for the wasting of The Changing of Forms, and heretic actions of other's commands of undead. 

To other aspects, Moandiir represents Lolth's uncontrolled spread of corruption. They are wary of Moandiir's followers because they command poison and corruption expertly, yet are revered for their mastery of the forms of existence. Though Moandiir gave sight to Vhontree Maeth to see the corruption the dragonkind had wrought upon the land, the other aspects view her as unpredictable and carefree when it comes to the cycles of life. To meet a Moandiir resident is to be uncertain of existence.
