# Lothiriel

	"Surface walkers have tales of flying too close to the sun, but that is easy 
	to avoid. We avoid straying too close to our savior's shadow, for it will 
	swallow us in zealot fury and undo all we have striven for. We learn from 
	Lothiriel's failures, to be better Drow." -- Unknown

Lothiriel is an aspect that is now talked about only in hushed conversations and frequently associated with that of warning, of a check in drow egos. Those who are followers of Lothiriel are seen as zealots, extremisits, and ultimately heretics for daring to walk in Lolth's shadow without earning such grace. Though they do exist in The Web of Drow, you will be hard pressed to find an openly practicing follower of Lothiriel's aspect of Lolth -- lest they be slain.

# Summary
Lothiriel is seen as the original, the first, the blazing light of the dawn that is the true queen of the Drow people. This aspect rules over the hearts of the Drow and guides them in their devotion to the old way.

Lothiriel does not interact with the mortal world anymore. Her people have all but disappeared into Tartaran and their descendants no longer revere her openly as they should. For those who truly turn to the glorious heart of the dark queen, they will discover the awesome power of the first ancestor. Some believe this aspect to be not just Lolth's original form, but her *ultimate* form, the prime Spider Queen. However, many of her people rejected her despite her gifts of sanctuary and strengthening and so she watches silent. 

Lothiriel represents the sacrifice made in bringing the weak into arm's reach, knowing it might mean one's own destruction. She also represents the deeds of those of the Drow that died to secure their home, those who gave their lives to ensure escape from annihilation from dragonking. Lothiriel lastly represents the siren-like call power has on those undeserving, of straying too close to the awesome power of Lolth and the punishment of taking that which you have not earned. She suffers eternally for the bargains made for Drow to survive the underdark, a fraction of who she once was. 

The Guardians of Lothiriel must now restore her to her rightful place, as the unquestioned queen of the Drow. Her followers know it will take time, generations will pass, but it must be done for the good of their goddess and her people. If this aspect is to be no more, then the Drow lose the heart of their savior and the link to their ancestors, which will be needed to conquer the dragonkind. 

She represents the origins and what Drow used to be before the great sundering. To learn from her is to learn of a core tenent of Drow society: those not strong enough will perish. It is to be filled with the awe and majesty of her true power and of the potential Drow have to reach but a fraction of it. Her followers are tasked with reminding Drow of where they have come from, always, and where they are aspiring to be -- by the side of the Spider Queen Lolth. 

Though many believe teachings of Lothiriel are aligned with that of the other aspects, few will admit it. Her followers are seen as too ambitious, of striving to skip the step of pain in the pathway to gaining strength. To look upon the true queen without first earning said honor is to risk blindness from her radiant brilliance. It is to risk heartrending sorrow and an undying thirst for revenge. It is to risk damning the entire Drow people for once again taking what they do not deserve yet. The Drow have been chosen by Lolth to suffer, to painstakingly climb the webbed ladder to reach her...to take a shortcut is to set fire to the web. 

The other aspects believe Lothiriel to be not the ancestor, or ultimate form of Lolth, but an aspect of her temptation, of her raw power that led Vhontree Maeth to her in the first place. To follow this path is to follow heresy. To follow this path is to not follow the drow savior Queen as she is, but as she *was*.
