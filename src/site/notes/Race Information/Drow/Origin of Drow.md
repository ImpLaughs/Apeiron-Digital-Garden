# The Web of Drow
The collective of Drow societies spread throughout Soven'dul is known as The Web of Drow (or The Web). The Web of Drow consisted of six distinct societies with different rule, regions, repsonsibilities, and customs. Though it is often a mistake to think The Web is a cooperative society within Soven'dul, as The Drow are firm believers in their customs and survival of the fittest/strongest. Though The Web will come together to support the Drow race, it is not often done without favors, support, gifts, trades, or sacrifice. 

## History
The Elves were one of the few races to witness the destruction of [[The Scale War|The Scale War]]. Though many elves retreated into the icy plains, the deep jungles and wilds, or to the seas, one large group followed the leadership of one [[Vhontree Maeth|Vhontree Maeth]], a woman who claimed to hear whispers of sanctuary. It is there, with the elves seeking safetry from the burning world above, the Drow were homed.

Vhontree Maeth guided her elvish people deep below the rock of Soven'dul to what is now known only as The Woven Throne -- where they encountered the power, teachings, and safety of Lolth. 

Turned and twisted by Lolth's power and machinations, the elves that had found their way to the Woven Throne found themselves acolytes to The Queen of Spiders. The elves found themselves twisted to fit their new home, the underdark of Soven'dul before The Sundering of the World. Hiding beneath the rock, the Drow came to drift from their elvish heritage to something greater, something darker, and something meant to survive all. 

It is then that those first Children of Lolth followed their Queen's command in spreading her reach far beyond the world. Following The Sundering of the World, the dragons' war had weakened and corrupted Lolth to the dismay of her followers. As such, when the world split...so too did her conciousness. Deeply saddened and traumatized by the weakening of their savior goddess, the Drow swore revenge on all dragonkind (and their ilk), developed a distrust of all other races as they suffered "the most" from the war, and believed themselves to be better as the dragons sought their queen out and not any others. However, that distrust soon stirred within and among the drow themselves, not trusting each other as they followed different aspects of Lolth, believing each one to be "the spider's heart". 

As such, the Drow split into seven different cultures, same as their goddess. Taking to various parts around the world, trying to become strong enough to bring Lolth to full power, seek revenge on dragonkind, and rise to rule as they deserve to be, the drow isolated themselves within their under-kingdoms for years. 

Life in the seven kingdoms of Soven'dul (though many existed off continent) was anything but easy. Without the full power of their goddess to protect them, The Drow had to learn to fend for themselves, to survive, to rule, and to take. Each one sought to emulate the aspect of Lolth they had followed, beliving each to be The Spider's Heart. Though many skirmishes and backstabs occured between the Eight Cities, none were as immense and pivotal as The [[Race Information/Drow/Aspects of Lolth/Lothiriel|Lothiriel]] Deception.

As each Drow kingdom sought to follow their queen's aspect, The Followers of [[Race Information/Drow/Aspects of Lolth/Lothiriel|Lothiriel]] saw her as the ancestor, the spark of the spider. While the other cities fought, stole, and survived, the kingdom of [[Race Information/Drow/Aspects of Lolth/Lothiriel|Lothiriel]] schemed, plotted, and infiltrated. In what became known as The Great Deception, acolytes of [[Race Information/Drow/Aspects of Lolth/Lothiriel|Lothiriel]] struck within each of the seven kingdoms -- eliminating their rulers to take control of the entire Drow population in one fell swoop. Their goal was to bring all Drow to their provence and to providence: to cross to where they believed their goddess was healing, to where they could join by her side...Tartaran. 

Viewing such a pilgramige to sacred lands, war among the Drow spread like wildfire. Brother fought brother, father slew child, and child burned ancestors as the Drow feared the heretic actions of [[Race Information/Drow/Aspects of Lolth/Lothiriel|Lothiriel]]'s people. The Drow people, separated by such great distance and misunderstandings of the varying cultures, were too weak to handle the brutality and deception of [[Race Information/Drow/Aspects of Lolth/Lothiriel|Lothiriel]]. They failed to stop [[Race Information/Drow/Aspects of Lolth/Lothiriel|Lothiriel]] from somehow bridging the gap between realm, from venturing forth into Tartaran. 

Such a rip through reality created a scourge within the material plane, as [[Race Information/Drow/Aspects of Lolth/Lothiriel|Lothiriel]] and her people ventured into the dark. With many loved ones gone, the remaining Drow swore this deception would never happen again on such a grand scale. WIth no way to contact their loved ones, their stolen family, or to stop their heretical lineage, the remaining Drow formed The Web of Drow. With one purpose -- ensure survival of the people in the shadow of Lolth. 

Having to move on from The [[Race Information/Drow/Aspects of Lolth/Lothiriel|Lothiriel]] Deception, the Drow kingdoms formed a network of trust and loose cooperation between themselves and the other aspects of Lolth they followed. Still believing their own aspect to be the most important, though, the kingdoms saw the cooperation of drow as guiding the blind and less of equal teamwork. 

With many years passing since The [[Race Information/Drow/Aspects of Lolth/Lothiriel|Lothiriel]] Deception, the six Drow kingdoms now work in relative peace with each other to ensure Drow survival, Drow strengthening, nurturing of Lolth's recovery, and leads to gurantee dragon annihilation. Once every year, the six kingdoms meet at the base of the old [[Race Information/Drow/Aspects of Lolth/Lothiriel|Lothiriel]] kingdom in a summit -- only those present know what occurs in such meetings.
