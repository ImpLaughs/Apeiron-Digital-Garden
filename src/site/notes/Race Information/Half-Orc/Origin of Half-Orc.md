# Half-Orc
	"They embody the Wild in a cage. To face a half-orc is to face a storm of 
	temptation and potential. It is best to not judge a book by its cover with 
	them, for there are outliers even within the clans. No two are alike." - 
	Fandel's Guide to Survival

## Summary
With direct lineage drawn to the wrathful aspects of nature itself, half-orcs are seen as a people of potential and great destruction. They contend with the intense emotions of their lineage and the customs proper while trying to control nature itself to become a member of society with their other half. Neither side fully accepts half-orcs; orcs seeing them as needing to prove themselves true orc with genetic shackles, human/elves seeing them as dangerous and to be watched. The half-orc people work to show that orcs aren't barbaric or uncivilized, just misunderstood and that they can be worked with. Any race deemed suitable to the Orcish Clan can be a parent to a half-orc, but to the half-orc their orcish lineage is the dominant trait to make them similar builds with similar features. 

Their role in The Scale War fell in line with that of mortals.

## Frozen Half-Orcs
Frozen Half-Orcs of light blue coloring contend with the harshness and emotionless nature of the cold. They struggle to show proper emotion with their companions. Frozen Half-Orcs are more likely to breed with other races, and are a more traditional family parentage as a result. Half-orc children of this subrace aren't looked upon as cautiously by Common kingdoms, seeing them as "a more civlized breed." But it is the Frozen Half-Orcs that one must be most cautious of, as snow might appear beautiful and serene...yet vengeful and unforgiving. 

## Flame Half-Orcs
Flame Half-Orcs are rare purely because Flame Orcs hardly see any other race as worthy of sharing their genetics. Flame Half-Orcs of dark brown coloring must contend with the distinct and ever-present call for battle and duels. They struggle with this bloodlust and thirst to see violence in their vicinity. Their parentage is seen as militaristic, if their orcish parent is even alive or in the picture. Half-orc children of this subrace are looked upon with extreme caution, as they are more likely to fall to the temptations of the desert and its survival of the fittest situation; however, half-orc children of this subrace actively work to prove that Flame Orcs are not killing machines, but something more. One would do well to not cross a Flame Half-Orc, though. 

## Sootrock Half-Orcs
Sootrock Half-Orcs of dark black and gray coloring are constantly contending with the strength they hold. They struggle with their raw strength and tend to be excellent at breaking things when it would not be appropriate. They also have a inner-call of seeing rebirth through destruction, of rising from the rubble anew. Their parentage is hardly seen, as Sootrock Half-Orcs are born from Sootrock Orcs that have left their clan, which rarely happens (when it does, they do not survive). Half-Orc children of this subrace are looked upon as walking wrecking balls, a warning of what happens when one does not work in moderation. However, the children of this subrace seek to create, to build as much as they destroy, to embody the qualities of their ancestors that aided in the fall of dragons. 

## Tidal Half-Orcs
Tidal Half-Orcs of seagreen coloring must always contend with their emotions getting the better of them. They are quick to love, hate, fear, and more, as the sea is tempermental and rarely predictable. They also struggle with feelings of loyalty to creed or bannerment, as the sea rarely likes to be caged. This race is the most common of subraces as Tidal Half-Orcs live hedonistically, though most stick to the coasts while their half-orc children filter through the mainland. Their parentage is distant, yet firm in their loyalties to their own kind. Half-Orc children of this subrace are looked upon as untrustworthy, unpredictable, and holding deep treachery for these qualities the sea has. However, the children of this subrace seek to guide, to mentor, to teach, to forge bonds, and to show there is value in putting yourself first and how that typically helps the many. They seek to understand and spread "one for all, and all for one." 

## Tainted Half-Orcs
Tainted Half-Orcs of various coloring not mentioned prior (light blue, dark brown, black, gray, seagreen) are seen as outcasts by all half-orc and orc alike. They are the spawn of orc and [[Race Information/Tiefling/Origin of Tiefling|tiefling,]] of nature's wrath and demonic vengeance. As such, they come in a variety of colors. Whereas many people know what to expect when dealing with the other subraces, Tainted Half-Orcs are even more unpredictable as Tidal Half-Orcs: one never knows what they align to. Some might give in to their demonic temptations and be harbingers of unrelenting and unfiltered destruction. Some may embody the greedfueled nature of demons and hoard all. As such, Tainted Half-Orcs tend to fall into one of the Nine Hells, having to contend with one or many of the follies brought upon the material by the demonic. Half-Orc children of this subrace seek to rise above their horrific name, to bridge the gap between nature and demon, to show they are more than their blood.
