# Dragonborn
	"Our birth is of destruction and war. In our life, we choose to rise above 
	our creators. To be better. We hold our power with restraint and honor, for 
	the might of world destroyers courses through our veins." - Faithful the 
	Amber

# Summary
It was during [[The Scale War|The Scale War]] that the Metallic and Chromatic dragons found need for a more ground-based assault. Separately, the two dragonflights combined their magics to formulate underlings of great power in their own image. What resulted was known as Dragonborn. 

### Chromatic Dragon Ancestry
Once [[Ashardalon|Ashardalon]], the great red dragon, had reached the power of Greatwrym, they realized the chromatic dragon's lack of soldier. Needing to quell the battlefield of mortals, Ashardalon hunted down a powerful dragon known as [[Elek'torum|Elek'torum]], and utilized their magical capabilities to do what was needed. With the soul of Elek'torum in his grasp, Ashardalon fused the earth with the dying dragon scales to formulate the first dragonborn. 

These dragonborn represented Elek'torum's physique with Ashardalon's ferocity. With wings on their back, these dragonborn could take flight and do battle with the likes of man while contending with the metallic dragons well. 

### Metallic Dragon Ancestry
Fearing the might of the Chromatic Dragons, the metallic dragons colluded to ascend one of their own to become a Greatwrym. It was then [[Jalanvaloss|Jalanvaloss]]' task to garner support from the mortals to rival Ashardalon's power. By heading a church of worship to metallic dragons, the silver dragon Jalanvaloss garnered enough praise and support to allow them to become a Dragon ascendant. With immense power, Jalanvaloss chose their most devout followers and, as reward, gave them the ability to defend their land from the chromatic threat. 

These dragonborn represented Jalanvaloss' belief in unification of dragonkind despite their efforst in the war. As such, these dragonborn looked more mortal than the chromatic counterparts. This look allowed them to better rally troops on the mortal fields, leading them to victory and worship to give Jalanvaloss more power. 

## The Confluence
Though both bred from different purposes and origins, the dragonborn were on the frontlines of The Dragon War. They saw mortals slain and landscapes decimated from the war firsthand. It was in their battles against each other that they reached a conclusion -- neither wanted what they were created for. Together, Chromatic and Metallic dragonborn alike formed [[The Confluence|The Confluence]], an order of peace keepers from both sides to end the war once and for all. 

Hiding under the noses of their creators, the dragonborn fed intel to the mortals and tried to minimize loss and destruction as best they could. It was then they learned of [[The Lapidary|The Lapidary]] after they had punched a hole through to the astral plane. In their retreat from the material plane, they allowed the way for abberations of great power to come through. Unfortunately, such power came in the form of beholders. 

## The Closed Eye and Large Luigi
In secret, [[The Closed Eye|The Closed Eye]] formed, a collection of a few Confluence members and mortals alike, and began their quest to hunt and utilize the power of a beholder to end the reign of dragonkind. Deep in the underdark, following the trail of elven traitors escaping the war, The Closed Eye met [[Large Luigi|Large Luigi]], a wizened beholder flung from their home. They convinced Large Luigi to utilize their power to rid them of the chromatic dragon threat. In a single night, the Chromatic Dragons had been turned to stone, and hidden away forever. 

Believing the threat to be ended, Large Luigi thanked the Closed Eye for their story he could tell, and left the material plane with different purposes (promising to return one day). Peace began to fall upon the land until so too did the Metallic Dragons vanish from the realm, never to be seen again. 

# Dragonborn Types
### Amber 
With scales of amber color, these dragonborn are descendants of Ashardalon's Searing Light in the midst of the Scale War. With wings and a ferocious look to them, Amber Dragonborn are the only remaining evidence of the possibility of gemstone dragons. Nicknamed "The First of the Flight", they are regarded as the most dangerous of the dragonborn, yet also the ones with the most potential. The rarest of the types, they draw attention wherever they may go, with whispers of their possible betrayal following in their mighty shadows. They are known for their Radiant breath, which is said to be the last breath of Elek'torum in the face of Ashardalon.

### Brass
Scales of brass mark these dragonborn forged by their metallic ancestors. Some of the most common dragonborn present, and seen as the most approachable and most mortal-like. They wield fire within themselves as the metallic aim to use chromatic strength against them. Though numerous in population, the Brass are similar to their dragon counterparts in that they thrive with communicating and conversing with people, most being fluent in several languages naturally. It is rumored that, when needed most, Brass dragonborn are capable of emitting a sleeping gas to avoid a fight.

### Bronze
Resembling the fierce brozne dragons of old, bronze dragonborn have four horns and are frequently tipped with green. They frequently smell of sea spray and are one of a few dragonborn to be able to have two different breath weapons: one of lightning and the other of a fear-inducing toxin. Dragonborn of the Bronze subtype are staunch believers in taking lives only when absolutely necesary, and are frequently found in the armies of Soven'dul. There are rumors that Bronze dragons, though hesistant to take lives needlessly, revel in the loss of it as it empowers them.

### Copper
Smelling of cut stone, copper dragonborn resemble their counterparts with short faces and cheek ridges -- giving off a pensive look. Said to be even-tempered and sociable, they are known to play pranks and tell jokes often. This predisposition makes them frequently take up bardic aspiration, while wrestling with overwhelming greed and envy. Many have an acidic breath weapon but there are rumors of some that are capable of slowing anyone within their cone of an expelled gas. There are also rumors that copper dragons are able to interact with the currency of Soven'dul in ways unknown to others.

### Gold
Some of the rarest of the dragonborn, gold dragonborn are characterized by a short face with long, smooth horns. Said to smell of saffron and incense, gold dragonborn are rumored to be the most prime dragonborn, born of the powerful Gold Dragons. Gold dragonborn are typically seen as leaders in society, and if they are not then it is expected of them to take up the seat of leadership. Keeping to themselves mostly, gold dragonborn find peace upon the open fields, islands in the sea, and quiet forests of Soven'dul. Utilizing the breath of fire at their command, there are rumors of gold dragonborn capable of releasing a cone of weakening gas. They consistently struggle with the desire to lead the weak under their command, fearful of bringing about a second Scale War. 

### Red
Scales of scorching red, these dragonborn are direct descendants of Ashardalon. Wings of leather and ferocious faces, red dragonborn are plentiful and seen as warnings of complacency. As such, these dragonborn experience the weight of expectations to subvert society's reactions to them, and are ever vigilant of their lineage's return. Capable of the hottest of fire breath, red dragonborn are seen throughout, still attemting to atone for the sins of their creators. It is rumored that these dragonborn, despite their appearance, are the weakest of the lot, which is what makes them dangerous should the dragons return to Soven'dul.

### Silver
Silvered scales reminiscent of the currency of Soven'dul, Silver dragonborn are slender and regal compared to their cousins. They contend with the love of feasts and food from their creators, and are said to have a breath weapon of freezing. Rumors abound as some claim to have the ability to breathe a gas of paralysis. The silver dragonborn are as numerous as the reds, yet do not share their societal weight upon their shoulders, being some of the first to form The Confluence.
