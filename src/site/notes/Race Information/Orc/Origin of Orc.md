# Orc
	"They embody the Wild itself. To face an orc is to face nature's wrath. Best 
	avoided, but if one cannot...prove your worth and your blood. Maybe you'll 
	survive." - Fandel's Guide to Survival

[[Race Information/Half-Orc/Origin of Half-Orc|Click for Half-Orc Information]]
## Summary
One of the oldest races of Soven'dul. They existed on the edges of the wilds, thriving in the hottest and coldest parts of the world. Currently, they are seen as an uncivilized, tribal people: masters of heat and cold, wielders of barbaric untamable beasts, and lovers of passion and emotion. Previously known to be pivotal in The Scale War, they now are split and pushing back against civilizations encroaching on their lands. 

## Frozen Orcs
The Frozen Orcs of the Far North and Far South, these orcs thrive in cold weathers. Their skin mimics that of ice and snow, giving way to light blue skin tones. They believe in the innate power of the cold -- they worship their gods through suvival of the wilds. They're known for riding fabled beasts of ice and snow to conquer the wastes. 

During The Scale War, the Frozen Orcs were commanded by Chromatic Dragons to forge weapons, ride beasts, and create armor for the dragonkind as they saw the dragons of cold to be manifestations of their nature. To them, they were aiding their source of power...their source of blood. It wasn't until The Closed Eye formed that the Frozen Orcs were swayed by the Dragonborn of Chromatic Dragons to revolt. As such, the Frozen Orcs began collecting beasts of the frozen wastes...culminating in The Thaw: a great battle between Frozen Orcs, Dragonborn and the Dragon Loyalists. 

After The Scale War, the Frozen Orcs reside in the chilled plains of North Soven'dul. They live peacefully with the land and its inhabitants, often at odds with neighboring kingdoms as they view their expansion as a destruction of their people...of their blood. Not openly at war with any kingdom, The Frozen Orcs are easily placated and dealt with through signs of respect and proving of one's hardiness. 

## Flame Orcs
The Flame Orcs reside within the hottest deserts where they thrive. Their skin mimics that of the sandstone, giving them a rough, browned skin tone. They believe in the innate power of the rolling sands, the waves of heat -- they worship their gods through trial by combat. They're known for riding the beasts that can survive the deserts and building structures that can stand against the rolling sands. 

During The Scale War, the Flame Orcs were commanded by The Chromatic Dragons to train their combatants in combat while constructing the machines of dragonsiege. To them, they were aiding the strongest source of their power...their source of blood. It wasn't until The Closed Eye formed that the Flame Orcs encountered resistance. Though it might have been in their best interest to join The Closed Eye, the Flame Orcs remained loyal to who they viewed as the strongest in the land -- Chromatic Dragons. As such, The Boiled Purge occured between resistance and loyalists, with both sides losing many forces. 

After The Scale War, the Flame Orcs reside in the southern deserts of Soven'dul. They make up a large portion of forces in the Ma'Duat Dynasty against the northern regions to prove they are the strongest. They actively resist other kingdoms, sometimes even the Ma'Duat Dynasty themselves, if they view them as weaker. They are best dealt by showing one's strength immediately, or avoided.

## Sootrock Orcs
The Sootrock Orcs reside within the deepest pits of the planet. Their skin mimics that of the bedrock, giving them a dark black or gray skin tone. They believe in the innate power of the earth itself, the shifting of tectonic plates -- they worship their gods through molding of stone through brute force. They're known for combatting all manner of beast that dwell beneath the earth in its hottest places and in the darkest places, and in constructing weapons and armor with earthen might. 

During The Scale War, the Sootrock Orcs were commanded by The Metallic Dragons to forge tools for their armies as well as providing strongholds for them to dwell within. To them, they were aiding earthshakers...their source of blood. It wasn't until The Closed Eye formed that the Sootrock Orcs were swayed by the resistance...culminating in The Sundering. They are the ones who held the lands together during the war, the ones who aided in the destruction of their earth shakers, of rising above the rubble. 

After The Scale War, the Sootrock Orcs reside deep under the ground in various mountain ranges. They keep to themselves and not much is known of them beyond chance encounters with them in mountain passes...which often end in never being seen again. 

## Tidal Orcs
The Tidal Orcs reside within the waves of The Deep Waters. Their skin mimics that of the seaweed and waves, giving them a seagreen skin tone. They believe in the innate power of the tide, the push and pull of the riptide -- they worship their gods through the conquering of the sea itself through crafty maneuvers. They're known for commanding ships of any size, shape, or make, battling great sea monsters, embodying the will of the ocean (which is often destructive), and crafting tools of the sea. 

During The Scale War, the Tidal Orcs were commanded by The Metallic Dragons to transport their forces and detect weaknesses in enemy camps with the might of the oceans. To them, they were aiding the parters of the ocean itself...their source of blood. It wasn't until The Closed Eye formed that the Tidal Orcs realized the folly of their ways. The sea is not easily contained nor swayed, and neither should they. They absconded from the war, taking their knowledge and tactics with them, to embolden their forces and embody the ocean by being unrelenting in their testing of others. 

After The Scale War, the Tidal Orcs reside in the oceans and waters of Soven'dul as well as their coasts. They hold no reservations against race, creed, or banner. Those who meet them are unsure of part of the sea's wrath they will meet, or when, but it is best advised to prepare for the worst.
