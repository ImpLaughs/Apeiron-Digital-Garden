# Eladrin
	"Few advocate for freedom more than Al Hadarim's Eladin and fewer still can 
	say their connection to nature itself grounds, yet frees them. The Eladrin are 
	nature personified in their most restrained, cerebral state. However, the 
	consequences of their choices weighs heavy on their heads."

## Summary
A collection of people from another realm. They existed within a realm of wood and light, where nature itself held sway over its denizens. Following the foresaking by their creator, [[Divine Beings/The Prime Deities/Individual/Corellon|Corellon]], the Eladrin left their home with pieces of it within them, only to find a place that would be their true calling. Not seen frequently in Apeiron, they stay to their realm of The Feywild typically, but many see their kin in the Elves of Apeiron. 

## Eladrin Creation
Long before [[The Scale War|The Scale War]], Corellon, one of the Prime Deities, created the realm of [[Arvandor|Arvandor]]. In this land of forests, hills, and the wilds, the proto-Eladrin were born and led. Never dying by old age, the proto-Eladrin known as the [[LeShay|LeShay]], spent their time in the Eternal Hunt and Boundless Gather with Corellon -- their royal leader. Though Arvandor was paradise, some saw the life they led as mere servants who lived only to serve and serve to live. In secret, a small group met to exist without their creator in the wilds. 

Initially, these meetings were purely recreational. A place for the LeShay to thrive and ultimatley find themselves without their creator's influence. Over time, most of the LeShay had taken membership into the group, led by the LeShay known as [[Al Hadarim|Al Hadarim]]. The safety of their group would not remain in tact, for Corellon soon found their "escape". Calling sacriliege, and betrayal, Corellon banished the followers of Al Hadarim out of their home of Arvandor by firing an arrow of starlight at their feet. The arrow pierced the ground, creating ravines around their self-made hideaway in the wilds, blinding the betrayers, and searing their flesh of Corellon's influence. It is believed Corellon's last words to the LeShay were: "If Tel'Rûn nha sen var (pl) kerradun Tel'Rûn nha kar viaren (pl) faen" *(If what you crave is the land, then it shall be your life instead of me)*. The fires of the starlight effectively forged a connection between the LeShay and the pocket of land they had found sanctuary in. The melding of life was excruiating in the light of Divine power, and it bathed the eyes of the LeShay in celestial light alongside the Wilds. With an arrow pushing the land away from Arvandor, the LeShay drifting away from their home, they careened through the cosmos. 

It is said the drifting from Arvandor allowed the land itself to create a shield and enough celestial power to protect her people -- the surviving LeShay. What emerged from blinding light was a land of magic and overgrowth alongside a people forever twisted by the wilds itself. In the blinding light, the LeShay forged new homes with Al Hadarim's leadership. Their eventual death, though tragic to their new people, was the final fallen leaf of their connection to Corellon. Adopting Al Hadarim's name, to the people, would ensure his life eternal. Through this, the Eladrin were born. 

## Eladrin Physiology
Eladrin exhibit the spirit of the wilds itself, and thus look as though they belong in the wilds through camouflage. They typically have twigs, leaves, moss, tree bark, mushrooms, or even small animals living alongside their once twisted bodies. As part of nature, they are able to mimic her cycle to suit their lifespan -- Leaffall, Simmyr, Spryng, and Windsturn. Eventually these seasons would colloquially be called Fall/Autumn, Summer, Spring, and Winter. 

| Season             | Meaning                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Leaffall (Fall)    | peace and goodwill, when the harvest is shared with all                                      |
| Windsturn (Winter) | contemplation and dolor, when the vibrant energy of nature slumbers, a reminder of The Exile |
| Spryng (Spring)    | cheerfulness and celebration, marked by merriment and hope                                   |
| Simmyr (Summer)    | boldness and aggression, a time of unfettered energy and calls to action                     |

Eladrin that mimic the seasons connect their physical state with their mental state. Those in **Fall** are at peace and embody the spirit of Al Hadarim's gift of privacy and the coming together of people. Those in **Winter** are in contemplation, often associated with the repurcussions of their ancestory's actions. An Eladrin in **Spring** embodies hope and renewal, in that they have survived on their own and not as servants to another. **Summer** Eladrin are bold and agressive with boundless energy, a reminder of the philosophical and idealogical rebellion of Corellon that would lead to pain and heartache.
