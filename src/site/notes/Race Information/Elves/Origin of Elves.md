# Elves
	"We have lost as much as we have given, and it is with these choices that we press onward like the seasons. Our interference led to demise, yet our isolation would lead to catastrophe. We gracefully walk this line, and must take heed of what may lead us from our home again." - Niamh, First Elven Historian

## Summary
A people born out of good will, now reeling from a door closing and their own failure. The elves have brought with them immense knowledge and wisdom, but an otherworldly danger and capacity for great destruction. They walk the line of grace and destruction. Tempering the elements and their own emotions to live peacefully. 

## History
Many wonder *how* the Eladrin of the Feywild crossed over into the material plane, but few ask *why*. 

Having achieved somewhat peace with their decision and built something of a society in the Feywilds, the Eladrin were stunned to find that life existed beyond their realm. Known as "The First Cry," the Eladrin heard the pleas of a people in danger. It is unknown how these cries reached the Feywild -- many scholars believe it to be divine intervention, while others posit a rare form of magic -- but many agree that it was the impetus of this cry for help that led to the eventual fraction of Elves, birth of the Drow, and introduction of Fey Fever.  

Ælferich, the Eladrin explorer pushed for their people to answer the calls of Apeiron. Many were firm in not leaving a home they had worked so hard to make, while others argued that if they did not help...then they would be forsaking all they had been given. The Battle of Crowns was swift, lasting only four seasons in the Feywild, before Ælferich and their followers found a way to bridge the Feywild to Apeiron. Many would have commonfolk believe that the Eladrin arrived in a comet, or through a tear in the air. Common thought seems to agree that the Ælferich's Eladrin arrived on the first rainbow of Apeiron. 

Wanting to come to Apeiron to help and being able to help are, unfortunately, two different things. The Eladrin soon learned that although they were mighty and capable, the might of the Primordial Titans was overwhelming. The Eladrin soon learned that their own physiology and ecosystem did not cohabitate with Apeiron at all -- as Fey Fever started to spread. Fey Fever, a disease of varied symptoms, is a biological parasite that all Eladrin have due to the Feywild. Its symptoms vary from person to person, but they all resemble the mixture of the Feywild magic and mortal bodies: mushrooms growing, wasting disease, fever, welts, boils, sprouting of other appendages, becoming a changeling, or other symptoms. Though they helped start to turn the tide against the Primordial Titans with the mortals, Fey Fever soon began to eat away at all hope. 

Ælferich realized their mistake, and wanted to return home. However, they knew that the bringing of disease could wipe out their own home realm. This alone gave them no choice but to find a life on Apeiron away from paradise. During the Primordial War, yet before the introduction of Ashardalon, the Elves, as they were soon known as by many, found their ability to change seasons waning. It caused many to have to retreat to areas suited to their changing physiology: the water, or the jungles that resembeld their home, or the forests that reminded them of Arvandor. Ælferich's passing during Ashardalon's arrival marked the final nail in the coffin for the elves...this was their home, and they were a changed people once more.
