# The Science of Death
	"Few understand the intricacies of death, and even fewer those of life." 
	- Mivildir, The Mortician of Life

With thanks to [[Mivildir|Mivildir of the Mono'lak Observatory]], the resident archmages of Soven'dul have reached an understanding of death, in hopes to understand life. Having dedicated their life to understanding what occurs in death, Mivildir has brought a deep understanding of Apeiron's history, the great equalizer, and what is to come for Soven'dul. Although many believe the teachings of Mivildir to be fact and truth of the world, few can say for certain it's validity.

## Body
	"The first, and easiest, to die is the body. Everything you have done, or 
	ever will do, will be gone forever." - Mivildir, The Mortician of Life

It is said that the body is the one aspect of mortal life that acts as the true anchor to the material plane. To lose one's body is to lose your physical impact on the world. This is present in the rot of corpses, the decay of the world, and the base understanding of death to the denizens of Apeiron. Typically, the body is the first to die, as it is believed to be the most fragile on a plane much smaller than the others. 

To persist in life without a body is to be a specter, a ghost to walk among the realm of Apeiron.
## Mind
	"Next to die is the mind. Everything you have thought, or ever will think, 
	will be gone forever." - Mivildir, The Mortician of Life

The second thing to begin to fade and decay in death, is the mind of a creature. To lose one's mind is to lose their independent thought gifted to them by [[Divine Beings/Prime Deities/The Prime Deities|The Prime Deities]]. This absence of mind allows others to impose their own will upon a corpse. Though the body is the most fragile on the plane, the mind is the easiest target to hit. The mind is what binds an entity to their agency in Apeiron, and to be without it is to be an empty cup, ready to be filled with something else entirely. 

To persist in life without the mind is to be a walking corpse (ghoul, zombie, skeleton, or similar ilk) cursed to feed or obey upon the realm of Apeiron.
## Spirit
	"Then goes the spirit. Everything you were, or ever will be, will be gone 
	forever." - Mivildir, The Mortician of Life

The third thing to begin to fade and decay in death, is the spirit of a creature. The essence that resides in all living creatures, bound to body and mind, is the hardest to pin down, to find, to locate or trap. It is the emotions, the character, the soul of a being. 

It is said that, in death, this spirit leaves the material and inner planes to to outer in a journey to the afterlife. During this journey, necromancy thrives. The spirit first passes through, according to studies, the elemental planes where it is possible to become infused with the elements. If a soul survives the journey untouched, they are said to wait for judgement by [[Wee Jas|Wee Jas]] for ten material days. During that time, it is said that one is tempted by the powers of devils, falling to them sends one directly to the pits of Hell to join [[The Betrayer Gods|The Betrayer Gods]]' subordinate ranks. Wee Jas then decides one's fate -- to the diety of one's court if they showed deep devotion or to a plane to match one's alignment in life. Souls are said to be able to make a trade, if they are of true neutral like Wee Jas, to join their court. 

To persist in life without the spirit is to be an empty vessel for the dangers of death to fill. To persist in life without the spirit is to be as close to a god as a mortal could ever be, to be without the change in character, in morality. To persist in life without the spirit is to be a vampire, or lich, with your own, unfiltered will to force upon Apeiron.
## Name
	"Finally, for some this never happens, to go is the name. Every memory, ever 
	interaction or impact you've had or ever will have, will be gone forever." - 
	Mivildir, The Mortician of Life

The fourth, and last, aspect of life to begin to fade and decay in death, is the name of a creature. This encapsulates the impacts that creature had on all planes, in life and in death. It is said a creature is never truly dead until their name dies with them. For most mortals, the name fades gradually, in one to two generations after one's death. For others, their names are inscribed upon texts, to be remembered until that text frays and fades. For a rare few, of large impact, their name lives forever -- the only true form of immortality. The only known instance of a name being stricken down in life is with [[The Schism of the Divine|The Schism of the Divine]], and [[The Death of The Dead|The Death of The Dead]]. 

To persist in life without the name is impossible, as it is the last to go. The only beings to do so, live in the [[The Betrayer Gods|darkest pits of Hell]].
