The Betrayer Gods are the Creator Deities who chose the Primordials over the mortal planes. Their names have been stricken from existence by [[Divine Beings/The Prime Deities/The Prime Deities|The Prime Deities]]. Any power they once had in Apeiron, is as if they had never existed. They reside, it is said, in planes of their torment, locked far from the material plane, their enemies, and from any who would follow them.
